A team game of free-association.

- Two teams: blue and orange
- Each team has at least two members, one of which must be the team leader.
- For each game, a set of 16 "game" words is drawn from a master word list.
- The game words list is presented to all players, and everyone is given a minute to examine the list.
- The game words are assigned,or keyed, as follows:
    13 to teams (7 going to the team that goes first and 6 to the other one)
    3 are neutral
- The team that goes first is randomly assigned.
- The key is presented to both team leaders, and the first turn begins.
- At each turn, the team leader gets a minute to examine the board and provide a hint (one word) and a number of words to guess.
- The other team leader approves or rejects the hint.
- After it is approved, the team members get the hint and are given a minute to pick their guesses. They can choose how many words to guess, even zero, up to the maximum set by the leader. 
- Their guesses are ranked and evaluated one by one to check if they are correct. 
- If a word that is neutral or belongs to the other team is found during evaluation, that team's turn ends without the remaining words being examined.
- At the end of each round, if the members get all the number of guesses right, they can pick a bonus one.
- The first team to have all their words guessed wins.
